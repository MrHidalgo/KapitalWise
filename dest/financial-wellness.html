            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Most people haven’t studied finance or taken a course in personal financial management. They have a basic
              understanding of the products they need to conduct daily life and, possibly, to save for the future. Unless
              they’re wealthy, it’s likely they haven’t spent time with a financial advisor. And in today’s reality,
              they’re
              not having serious conversations with a banker in a branch – if they visit one at all.
            </p>
            <h2>How they are doing</h2>
            <ul class="statboxes">
              <li>
                <div class="states">44%</div>
                <div class="statesdesc">Americans don’t have enough cash to cover a $400 emergency</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="states">43%</div>
                <div class="statesdesc">Student loan borrowers are not making payments</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="states">38%</div>
                <div class="statesdesc">U.S. households have credit card debt</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="states">33%</div>
                <div class="statesdesc">American adults have $0 saved for retirement</div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So how do people get good information on the right types of accounts to open, goals to set and habits to
              form? For many, it’s a combination of advertisements, suggestions from friends and ad hoc decisions made
              without guidance. While not everyone has the income opportunity to become wealthy, most people would be
              relatively better off if they had more clarity on what steps to take and when to take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here we lay out the case for financial institutions to reclaim their reputations as trusted advocates for
              their customers’ financial well-being. If done well, this way of engaging customers yields better outcomes for
              both the bank and for its the customers. A customer that is growing in financial stability and wealth is
              ultimately one that is more profitable for the bank.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Financial Health?</h2>
            <p>
              Financial health and financial wellness are terms that have been broadly used in recent years. We define it
              as the strength of a person’s financial holdings and habits relative to their income and lifestyle. In other
              words, how stable they are today and how their habits are contributing (or detracting from) that stability.
              We believe that financial health should be examined like physical health: vitals (assets, debt, insurance)
              should be measured, and habits (saving, spending) should be taken into account.
            </p>
            <figure><img src="img/what-fh.png" alt=""></figure>
            <p>
              Financial health is also relative to a person’s peer group in terms of income and lifestyle. Someone making
              $40,000 can be relatively healthy if they have enough savings, spend less than they make and have overall
              could weather an uncertain future. On the other hand, someone earning $150,000 a year but spending beyond
              their means and with significant debt may be relatively unhealthy.
            </p>
            <h2>The Role of Banks</h2>
            <p>
              There was a time when banks were revered as institutions that provided not only secure storage of money but
              also highly professional financial advice. The relationship banking model, where a banker understood each
              customer’s situation and needs has largely been replaced with commoditized products that are sold and
              serviced through a variety of channels. That personalized touch, and contextual financial advice is gone.
              Paired with a reputational hit from the 2008 financial crisis, banks are less often seen as a trusted source
              of advice and planning.
            </p>
            <h2>How customers feel about managing their finance?</h2>
            <ul class="feel-statstics">
              <li>
                <div class="feel-number">59%</div>
                <p>Managing money is something I have to do, not something I want to do</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="feel-number">47%</div>
                <p>It reminds me of my financial burden</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="feel-number">37%</div>
                <p>I do not like to see the money I am spending</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div class="feel-number">31%</div>
                <p>It takes too much time</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="highlighttext">
              New apps have started to fill the gap. Money management, budgeting, micro-savings, and
              robo-advisory are just a few of the trends we’ve seen as consumers increasingly trust tech companies to help
              them build financial security. Banks, for the most part, have lagged in rolling out engaging technology to
              compete with the startups. Instead, their customers spend less time in their bank’s channels, and more time
              becoming loyal to another brand.
            </p>
            <h2>Huge opportunity</h2>
            <ul class="points">
              <li>
                Millennials are actively seeking financial advice and need help building credit, saving and managing
                finances
              </li>
              <li>Business owners and SEGs are looking for financial education for employees</li>
              <li>Boomers and seniors are concerned about income protection and many are looking for help</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Thinking Across Segments</h2>
            <p>
              Understanding your financial health and how to optimize it is important for everyone, regardless of their
              current income and wealth. While the advice should be different and personalized, banks should be providing
              recommendations to customers in every segment.
            </p>
            <figure class="wheel-block"><img src="img/wheel.png" alt=""></figure>
            <p>
              For customers who are living paycheck to paycheck, or perhaps just starting their careers, small actions can
              have a huge impact. Setting a modest savings goal and uncovering opportunities to pay down high-cost debt
              faster can lead to a long-term shift toward financial security. Customers at the other end of the spectrum can
              focus on other goals, such as how the diversity of their assets can improve the likelihood of generational
              wealth preservation. A solid financial wellness program should anticipate the needs of customers at every
              level of wealth and at every step of their financial journey.
            </p>
            <h2>Measuring Financial Wellness</h2>
            <p>
              In order to improve something, you must first be able to measure it. The cornerstone of a financial wellness
              program is the ability to score a customer’s financial health against a range of criteria and benchmark them
              against their peers. Knowing that you won’t have every piece of data about your customer’s finances,
              KapitalWise takes an iterative approach to build a score. As the customer gives you more information, the
              score’s accuracy improves, and more actions can be unlocked.
            </p>
            <figure><img src="img/flow.png" alt=""></figure>
            <p>
              We believe that to be financially healthy, a consumer should be able to weather multiple possible future
              scenarios. With the help of high-performance GPU computing, our algorithms are capable of scenario testing
              millions of different financial and life scenarios using our custom Monte Carlo simulators to predict the
              probability of future financial insecurity. Our algorithm includes current earnings, spending pattern,
              debt-to-income ratio, savings coverage of average expenses, credit score, retirement fund forecast, and
              insurance coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The individual is then benchmarked against their peers based as it relates to income level and cost of
              living. The score itself can be numerical, such as a scale of 40-100, and is also used to identify the
              actions that could be taken that would have the most positive impact on the score.
            </p>
            <h2>Using the Score</h2>
            <p>
              The FinWell score can be provided to relationship managers, such as via a CRM, or be part of a consumer
              digital experience. In a high-touch environment, relationship managers may use the score to help a customer
              develop a plan to address any gaps and improve the score over time.
            </p>
            <div class="meter-dashboard">
              <figure><img src="img/meter.png" alt=""></figure>
              <p>
                In a digital consumer experience, recommendations on how to improve the score can be displayed in a mobile
                or online banking experience, with the option to nudge customers toward changes that will improve their
                standing over time.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Long-Term Planning vs Seizing the Moment</h2>
            <p>
              A robust financial wellness program should help customers understand the value of long-term planning for
              their financial future. By providing a financial wellness score, a bank is taking the first step in a
              conversation to help their customers plot a long-term plan. The score can be paired with financial literacy
              information that is tailored to the opportunities the individual has to improve their financial well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a plan doesn’t guarantee success, however. In our busy lives, it’s easy to forget about a goal you’ve
              set or when to take the next step to secure your financial future. The best way to help customers achieve
              goals is to nudge them – at the right time – with a friendly reminder. The KapitalWise platform continuously
              analyzes the customer’s checking account and notices anytime there’s surplus cash that could be contributed
              to a savings or investing goal, or be used to pay down a loan. By sending a customer a notification at that
              moment, you ensure that there’s an opportunity to make progress before a goal is forgotten and the money is
              spent elsewhere.
            </p>
            <h2>Shared Success</h2>
            <figure><img src="img/shared-success.png" alt=""></figure>
            <h2>Customer’s success Financial Institution’s Success</h2>
            <p>
              This type of model is not only a win for the consumer, but it is invaluable to banks as well. With a more
              engaged, loyal client base, banks will see higher retention numbers and can spend less time and money
              battling the churn. Most importantly, by helping customers grow their financial success, the bank has more
              opportunities to cross-sell to a base that is also growing in affluence. This creates more profitable
              relationships and directly drives revenue for the institution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every bank and credit union should care about the financial health of their customers. The best ones will
              make it a pillar of their strategy.
            </p>
